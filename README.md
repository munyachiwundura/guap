Sorry I just couldn't resist ðŸ˜‚

## Background

Okay this on was a really fun on, Well just like every other next.js app i've made but what made this more interesting is why I made it, So I was trying to manage my finances so I don't turn into a mathematician at the end of the month ðŸ˜‚, I looked for an a but however I didn't have space on my phone to downaload a dedicated app [Send Galaxy S22 Money ðŸ˜‚](munyachiwundura@gmail.com), or able to find any good online solutions.

Shameless begging aside I decided to just go ahed and say "Fine I'll do it myself" and make my own money management app that can be Installed as a progressive web app, It also arrived as a great opportunity to learn TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and actualy implement darkmode on an app unlike [one of my creations](https://okerkilltodoapp.vercel.app) which only has a toggle but dosen't actually support dark mode.

I wen't on hunting for a desing on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com) and came along some designs by ()[], I went on and reverse enginnered them on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/N0Wl1Aueka5IQr7hRVK40E/Dashbords?node-id=0%3A1) and went on to develope the app in [Next](https://nextjs.org/)

## Getting Started

[Access the app](https://overkilltodoapp.vercel.app)

### Creating an Account

On initial load you will be redirected to the signup page, click get started.
Sing up with github which if you are reading this you probably have an account.
You will be then redirected to the home page after signing up.
